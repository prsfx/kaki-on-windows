# Kaki App on Windows 10

    "I hate Windows!" - someone/sombody

Me too.. *sometimes...

This is a preview for Kaki app using kivy and kivymd modules.

<a href="https://github.com/tito/kaki">Forked from tito/kaki</a>

- __Tested in:__
    - Windows 10 Home
    - Python 3.7.8

So far for basic application, this method is work.

But for far way more complex class, function, method and etc. Haven't tried yet.

## Personal note

Long before kaki been published. I'm a type of guy who using python way on kivy and kivy md with *super()* function. Usin this method with pylint is easy for lookin function inside tthe "class". *test it, test it till fail many times then stop.

But technology should make more easier. That's why you should use *.kv language and kaki/hot reload.

<br>

Also, if you guys already tested some performance I would like to know.

Alright, good luck!
